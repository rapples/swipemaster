        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Swipe Master is a fun and addictive puzzle game that challenges players to connect matching dots on a grid by swiping their finger. The game is easy to play but difficult to master, making it perfect for players of all skill levels.</p>
        <p>Each level of Swipe Master features a unique pattern of dots that must be connected within a certain time limit. The more dots the player connects, the higher their score. However, players must be careful not to run out of time, or they will have to start the level over.</p>
        <p>As the player progresses through the levels, the puzzles become more challenging, with more dots and less time to complete them. To help players beat the more difficult levels, Swipe Master offers power-ups like hints and extra time, which can be purchased using in-game currency or earned by watching ads.</p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>To play Swipe Master, simply swipe your finger to connect matching dots on the game grid. Each dot can only be connected to dots of the same color, and the connection must be made in a straight line with no other dots in between. The more dots you connect, the higher your score.</p>
        <p>Swipe Master also offers a multiplayer mode, where players can compete against each other in real-time matches. Each player is given the same pattern of dots, and the player who connects the most dots within a certain time limit wins the game.</p>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>Each dot that is connected is worth one point. The more dots you connect in a single move, the higher your score multiplier. The game also offers bonus points for completing a level before the time limit runs out.</p>
        <h2>Power-Ups</h2>
        <p>Swipe Master offers power-ups like hints and extra time to help players beat the more difficult levels. Hints can be used to highlight a dot that can be connected, while extra time can be used to add more time to the game timer.</p>
